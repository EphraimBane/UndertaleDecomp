## Do you have permission to share this?
I specifically emailed the fangamer UNDERTALE contact for permission, and was extremely specific that this was a DECOMP, and I was told explicitly:<br>
``Toby Fox's current stance is that non-monetized usage of UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE assets and music for fan projects by individuals is fine.``<br>
(If you represent Toby Fox, or any assets in this repository and need to contact me, please do so at vultumast@gmail.com)

## How do I use this?
Clone the repo, and open ``NXTale.yyp`` inside of Gamemaker Studio 2 (latest!)
